An arcade video game developed with Python and PyGame.

- Users control a Santa Claus character that is capable of fighting bad elves and The Grinch characters.
- Santa Claus loses health every time he/she defeats an enemy.
- This promotes having to use cookies to regenerate Santa's health.
- The goal here is to have the highest score without dying.
- Would like to implement a timer/end game with a top 10 leaderboard.
